# Licence

This code has been originally extracted from IPython 5.x-dev, so is under
IPython's LICENSE.

# Maintenance

This is a proof of concept, the IPython team does not maintain this packages
(even if individual members may contribute code). I (@Carreau), wrote it to see
how complex it would be to make it work, I have no intention of maintaining it,
of publishing it to PyPI.
