# Licence

This code has been originally extracted from IPython 5.x-dev, so is under
IPython's LICENSE.

# Maintenance

This is something that we offer in support of historical compatibility and
certain specific use cases where our main interface (prompt-toolkit) isn't
optimal. But we do not envision any significant development beyond fixing
critical bugs. We only have the resources to offer this as a best-effort
solution. If you are interested in doing any significant development on this
tool, please let us know via an issue, and we can explore transferring
maintainership of the package to you.
